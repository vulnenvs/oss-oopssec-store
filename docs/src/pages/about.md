**OopsSec Store** is an open-source, intentionally vulnerable e-commerce application designed for hands-on web security training. Built with Next.js and React, it provides a realistic environment to learn and practice web application security testing.

This blog documents writeups, walkthroughs, and solutions for the Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges embedded in the platform. Whether you're a penetration tester, security engineer, developer, or cybersecurity student, these guides will help you understand how real-world vulnerabilities manifest in modern single-page applications (SPA) with REST APIs.

## What is OopsSec Store?

OopsSec Store simulates a realistic e-commerce platform containing intentional security flaws including:

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
- JWT attacks
- Path traversal
- And many more OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

The goal is simple: hunt for hidden flags, exploit vulnerabilities, and level up your security skills in a safe, legal environment.

## Quick Start

```bash
# With Node.js
npx create-oss-store && cd oss-oopssec-store && npm start

# With Docker
docker run -p 3000:3000 leogra/oss-oopssec-store
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start hunting flags.

## Who is this for?

- Penetration testers looking for practice targets
- Security engineers wanting to sharpen their skills
- Developers learning secure coding practices
- Cybersecurity students preparing for certifications
- Anyone interested in application security (AppSec)
