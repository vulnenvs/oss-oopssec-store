/**
 * If you want to add a new flag, you can add it here.
 * The flag should be in the format of "OSS{flag}"
 * The cve is optional
 * The walkthroughSlug is optional (from https://koadt.github.io/oss-oopssec-store/)
 *
 * The markdown file should be in the content/vulnerabilities folder
 * The markdown file should be in the format of "vulnerability-name.md"
 *
 * Categories:
 * - INJECTION: SQL injection, XSS, etc.
 * - AUTHENTICATION: JWT, session, password issues
 * - AUTHORIZATION: IDOR, privilege escalation
 * - REQUEST_FORGERY: CSRF, SSRF
 * - INFORMATION_DISCLOSURE: Error messages, exposed data
 * - INPUT_VALIDATION: Path traversal, mass assignment
 * - CRYPTOGRAPHIC: Weak hashing, encryption issues
 * - REMOTE_CODE_EXECUTION: RCE vulnerabilities
 * - OTHER: Miscellaneous
 *
 * Difficulty levels:
 * - EASY: Basic exploitation, no special tools needed
 * - MEDIUM: Requires understanding of the vulnerability type
 * - HARD: Complex exploitation, multiple steps or deep knowledge required
 *
 * Hints:
 * When adding a new flag, also add 3 hints in `flagHints` below (keyed by slug).
 * Hints are ordered by level (1 = vague nudge, 2 = clearer direction, 3 = near-solution).
 * They are displayed progressively to help players who are stuck.
